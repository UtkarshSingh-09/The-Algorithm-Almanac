A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to answer technical questions based on the book *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"* by Aurélien Géron.

This project processes the book's content into a vector database and uses the **Flan-T5** Large Language Model to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user queries via a FastAPI backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Context-Aware Answers:** Uses RAG to fetch specific passages from the book before answering.
* **Smart Query Expansion:** Automatically expands simple queries (e.g., "SGD") into full questions to improve search results.
* **Verbatim Guardrails:** If a user asks a question that matches a known definition exactly, the system returns the direct text from the knowledge base.
* **Source Transparency:** API responses include metadata on whether the answer was generated by AI or retrieved directly from the text.
* **High Performance:** Built on FastAPI for asynchronous, fast request handling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** FastAPI
* **LLM:** `google/flan-t5-base` (Hugging Face Transformers)
* **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
* **Vector Database:** ChromaDB
* **Computation:** PyTorch & NumPy

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UtkarshSingh-09/The-Algorithm-Almanac.git
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn torch transformers sentence-transformers chromadb numpy
    ```

> **⚠️ Important:** This project requires a pre-populated `chroma_db` folder containing the vectorized book data. Ensure you have run your ingestion script before starting the server.

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

### Start the Server
Run the following command to launch the API:

```bash
python main.py
